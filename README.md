# USCIS_scanner
A quick and dirty tool to analyze case status at USCIS for a given date

This is very likely useless for anyone else, but I don't want to lose it so I might as well share it.

Yes, I know the code seems to be written by a monkey. A not bright one, that also didn't care much. 

It works for my case though.

For any given date (it default to mine, so make sure you pass your case number) it will scan the cases and get some stats.

Then, for a specific form type, it will break down the current status and compare with the last run, if any.

So you can, for your specific date and case type, get an idea of where you stand and how fast, or slow, things are moving.
